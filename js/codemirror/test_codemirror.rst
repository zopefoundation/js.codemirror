How to use?
===========

To include the basic codemirror javascript and CSS you just need to include a single resource.

You can import ``codemirror`` from ``js.codemirror`` and ``need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.codemirror import codemirror
  >>> codemirror.need()
